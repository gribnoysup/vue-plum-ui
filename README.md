# Plum UI

## What is this?

Plum UI is a set of desktop oriented components and directives
for Vue.js. I made them for fun, practice and most of all to make my dev life a
little easier. These elements are the ones that I used most of all while making 
varoius web tools and prototypes at work and I kinda like this adobe style for 
UI, so I figured why not make a new component library out of it.

## What can it do?

### Components

- Button
- FileSelect
- Icon
- Input
- Range
- Scroller
- Table
- ToggleGroup
- Window

### Directives
- Draggable
- Resizable
- Dropbox

## What is next?

I'll probably try to cover all this with tests and make some proper documentation
